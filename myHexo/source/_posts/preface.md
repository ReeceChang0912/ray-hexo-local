The first article is simply about my journey of writing blogs.

It started from 2020 April, and it goes through three epoches,which are worldpress,server,domain completed by myself, front edges coded by html while i was learning proto js,and then by components ,finnally back to a subtle cPanel linux server provided by GoDaddy .

It is really cool that i get GoDaddy with a whole systerm ,domain ,DNS, phpAdmin,worldPress easily i can write. And it is just 20 bulks more than a AliYun server or TenXun which both are junk now.

Actually this is a unexpected gain, it give me an enlightnment that you should always try something new ,you may see a different world.
